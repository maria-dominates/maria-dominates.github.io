            <h1>My App Building/Designing Case Studie</h1>
            <p>Here you can look through one of my projects in great depth, including process, challenges, and final results.</p>
            <p>During Design class last year we were tasked to build a app using Thunkable and Firebase. The goal was for our apps to be able to create, read, update and delete. We were learning about "relationshipsbetween datasets can be modeled, analyzed, evaluated, and communicated in a variety of forms to recognize trends that influence our products, systems and institutions." Some process I went through include Brainstorming, Inquiring, Analysing, Reaserching, Creating Proto-Types, Building and Reflecting.
</p>


    <p>My app idea was to create a virtual Lost and Found so students could find their lost items faster, more effienctly and it would build the community by connecting with people who we don't usually connect with on a daily basis, informing them of where their lost item may be or if they've seen it since its been misplaced.</p>
